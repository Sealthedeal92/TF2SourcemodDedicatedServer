# TF2SourcemodDedicatedServer
This is a github repository used to help TF2 and their sourcemods have more server hosts easily by downloading most of the required content to start a public game.

(NOTE: these tutorials only work for windows, no other OS's sadly)

After downloading from this repository, open "tf2_install.bat" after you have assigned the download location in the tf2update.txt file, then you can safely open the .bat file and install the game.
Follow the guide in this OF server setup document i modified to have less steps. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UI3B4awG9gHNt0n3zekL0bPSuYzQoojS8K936sCxpvQ/edit?usp=sharing
