# TF2SourcemodDedicatedServer
This is a github repository used to help TF2 sourcemods obtain more server hosts easily by downloading most of the required content to start a public game.

Download for the server content can be found here, bundled into a zip to use less space on your hard drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bYzIHoSSj6fWE40Qo7STBvudCPfEDTCo/view?usp=sharing

(NOTE: these tutorials only work for windows, no other OS's sadly)

After downloading from this repository, open "tf2_install.bat" after you have assigned the download location in the tf2update.txt file, then you can safely open the .bat file and install the game.

(NOTE: in the server starting script you will need to change the text followed by -game to the desired TF2 sourcemod folder's name like open_fortress, or tf2classic for example)

Also keep in mind, that you may need to edit the .bat files for installing the server updates and starting your server, you should also configure "tf2update.txt & sdkupdate.txt" so you can update both tf2 and the sdk server inside of the files.

Follow the guide in this server setup document i modified which was designed to have less steps. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UI3B4awG9gHNt0n3zekL0bPSuYzQoojS8K936sCxpvQ/edit?usp=sharing
