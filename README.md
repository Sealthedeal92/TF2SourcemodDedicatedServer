# TF2SourcemodDedicatedServer
This is a github repository used to help TF2 sourcemods have more server hosts easily by downloading most of the required content to start a public game.

(NOTE: these tutorials only work for windows, no other OS's sadly)

After downloading from this repository, open "tf2_install.bat" after you have assigned the download location in the tf2update.txt file, then you can safely open the .bat file and install the game.

(NOTE: in the server starting script you will need to change the text followed by -game to the desired TF2 sourcemod folder's name like open_fortress, or tf2classic for example)

Follow the guide in this server setup document i modified which was designed to have less steps. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UI3B4awG9gHNt0n3zekL0bPSuYzQoojS8K936sCxpvQ/edit?usp=sharing
